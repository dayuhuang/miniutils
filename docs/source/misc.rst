Code Contracts
==============

Code contracting seems like a great way to define and document your code's expected behavior, easily integrate bounds checking, and just generally write code that tries to avoid bugs. The `pycontracts <https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/>`_ package provides this capability within python, but as soon as I started using it I realized that it was meant primarily to be robust, not concise. For example, consider the following code::

    class ObjA:
        pass

    class ObjB:
        pass

    @contract
    def sample_func(a):
        """A function that requires an A object

        :param a: A thing
        :type a: ObjA
        :return: What you gave it
        :rtype: ObjB
        """
        return ObjB()

This seems intuitive what should happen--you're not using any complex attributes of the types, merely indicating that is should be of that type--but ``pycontracts`` will croak on this because you haven't explicitly told it about your two new types.

``miniutils.magic_contract`` is a little wrapper around the ``contract`` decorator that looks through the function's local namespace, finds types that aren't already registered with ``pycontracts``, and adds them as a simple ``isinstance`` check. Using it, we can write almost the exact same code::

    class ObjA:
        pass


    class ObjB:
        pass


    @magic_contract  # Uses the magic contract
    def sample_func(a):
        """A function that requires an A object

        :param a: A thing
        :type a: ObjA
        :return: What you gave it
        :rtype: ObjB
        """
        return ObjB()

And now the function works like you'd expect. If you want to do something more complex when adding an object as a contractable type, just use ``contracts.new_contract`` like you normally would, and ``magic_contract`` won't clobber your definition. Also, since this decorator is just a wrapper around ``contracts.contract``, you can continue using ``pycontracts`` as always, and the magic contract won't affect any of the rest of your code.

Simplifying Decorators
======================

When writing a decorator that could be used like ``@deco`` or ``@deco()``, there's a little code I've found necessary in order to make both cases function identically. I've isolated this code into another decorator (meta-decorator?) to keep my other decorators simple (since, let's be honest, decorators are usually convoluted enough as is).

Consider the following decorator definition::

    def deco(return_name=False):
        def inner_deco(func):
            def inner(*a, **kw):
                if return_name:
                    return func.__name__, func(*a, **kw)
                else:
                    return func(*a, **kw)
            return inner
        return inner_deco

    @deco()  # Works correctly
    def g(i):
        return i

    @deco(True)  # Works correctly
    def h(i):
        return i

    @deco(return_name=True)  # Works correctly
    def k(i):
        return i

    @deco  # Fails, since f gets assigned to return_names instead of func
    def f(i):
        return i

This makes sense, but is somewhat annoying when parameters aren't required, such as is the case in several built-in Python decorators. To make this last case work like the first, we can simply decorate our decorator::

    @optional_argument_decorator
    def deco(return_name=False):
        def inner_deco(func):
            def inner(*a, **kw):
                if return_name:
                    return func.__name__, func(*a, **kw)
                else:
                    return func(*a, **kw)
            return inner
        return inner_deco

    @deco()  # Works correctly
    def g(i):
        return i

    @deco(True)  # This still works
    def h(i):
        return i

    @deco(return_name=True)  # As does this
    def k(i):
        return i

    @deco  # Now this works too!
    def f(i):
        return i

Logging Made Easy
=================

The standard ``logging`` module provides a lot of great functionality, but there are a few simplifications missing:

1. Intuitive colored logging to terminal
2. Fallback logging utilities when "logging" should only be enabled in certain contexts
3. "One-click" logging setup

As a slight simplification, ``miniutils`` provides a wrapper around the ``logging`` module to provide these features.

Usage
-----

To use the logging features listed below, just import the logger::

    from miniutils.logs import logger

If you want to use logging when available, but fall back to simply ``print`` to ``stderr`` when the logger isn't initialized elsewhere (for example, if you're writing a helper module that shouldn't dictate the logging format used in the user code), you can obtain a proxy logger object::

    from miniutils import logs_base as logger

This module has ``info``, ``warn``, ``warning``, ``error``, ``critical``, and ``log`` calls that use the logger when available, or fall back to a simple ``print`` statement otherwise. If the logger gets loaded from ``miniutils.logs`` later, these calls get swapped out automatically for their full-featured logger alternatives.

To change the logger's configuration, do something like the following::

    from miniutils.logs import enable_logging
    enable_logging(fmt_str='$(asctime) ( %(levelname) ) - $(message)')

This will swap out the logger and handlers that the rest of the logging utilities use.

.. autofunction:: miniutils.logs.enable_logging

Colored Logging
---------------

The ``coloredlogs`` module didn't quite work as expected when I tried to use it. It provides lots of handles and controls, but wasn't quite as intuitive as I expected it to be. To provide this more intuitive functionality, I wrap ``coloredlogs`` with a custom formatter that behaves more like expected:

- Don't assume the foreground color (it assumes black-on-white by default; I switch this to pulling the foreground color from the currently active color swatch)
- Uses case-sensitive match for level names (e.g., 'DEBUG', 'INFO', etc.), which seems silly. I monkey-patch this to be case insensitive
- Doesn't color aliases properly, even though it nominally supports name aliases


Timing
======

Simple ``printf``-like timing utilities when proper profiling won't quite work.

Timing Functions
----------------

To make a timed call to a function::

    from time import sleep
    from miniutils.timing import timed_call

    def f(a, *, x=1, sleep_dur=0.1):
        sleep(sleep_dur)
        return a * x

    result = timed_call(f, 2, x=3, sleep_dur=0.11)
    # "Call to 'f' took 0.110240s"

To make all calls to a function timed::

    from time import sleep
    from miniutils.timing import make_timed

    @make_timed
    def g(a, *, x=1, sleep_dur=0.1):
        sleep(sleep_dur)
        return a * x

    g(2, x=3, sleep_dur=0.11)
    # "Call to 'g' took 0.110242s"

.. autofunction:: miniutils.timing.timed_call

.. autofunction:: miniutils.timing.make_timed

Timing Blocks
-------------

Use ``tic``/``toc`` to time and report the run times of different chunks of code::

    from time import sleep
    from miniutils.timing import tic

    toc = tic()  # Just marks start time
    sleep(0.2)
    toc('Slept for 0.2 seconds')
    # "sample_timing.py:6 - Slept for 0.2 seconds - 0.200329s (total=0.2s)"
    sleep(.1)
    toc('Slept for 0.1 seconds')
    # "sample_timing.py:8 - Slept for 0.1 seconds - 0.100217s (total=0.3s)"

This utility is just less verbose than tracking various times yourself. The output is printed to the log for later review. It can also accept a custom print format string, including information about the code calling ``toc()`` and runtimes since the last ``tic``/``toc``.

.. autofunction:: miniutils.timing.tic

Pragma
======

When Python code is being executed abnormally, or being replaced entirely (e.g., by ``numba.jit``), it's sometimes highly relevant how your code is written. However, writing it that way isn't always practical, or you might want the code itself to be dependant on runtime data. In these cases, basic code templating or modification can be useful. This sub-module provides some simple utilities to perform Python code modification at runtime, similar to compiler directives in C.

Unroll
------

Unroll constant loops. If the `for`-loop iterator is a known value at function definition time, then replace it with its body duplicated for each value. For example::

    def f():
    for i in [1, 2, 4]:
        yield i

could be identically replaced by::

    def f():
        yield 1
        yield 2
        yield 4

The ``unroll`` decorator accomplishes this by parsing the input function, performing the unrolling transformation on the function's AST, then compiling and returning the defined function.

If using a transformational decorator of some sort, such as ``numba.jit`` or ``tangent.grad``, if that function isn't yet able to unwrap loops like this, then using this function might yield cleaner results on constant-length loops.

``unroll`` is currently smart enough to notice singly-defined variables and literals, as well as able to unroll the ``range`` function and unroll nested loops::

    @pragma.unroll
    def summation(x=0):
        a = [x, x, x]
        v = 0
        for _a in a:
            v += _a
        return v

    # ... Becomes ...

    def summation(x=0):
        a = [x, x, x]
        v = 0
        v += x
        v += x
        v += x
        return v

    # ... But ...

    @pragma.unroll
    def f():
        x = 3
        for i in [x, x, x]:
            yield i
        x = 4
        a = [x, x, x]
        for i in a:
            yield i

    # ... Becomes ...

    def f():
        x = 3
        yield 3
        yield 3
        yield 3
        x = 4
        a = [x, x, x]
        yield 4
        yield 4
        yield 4

    # Even nested loops and ranges work!

    @pragma.unroll
    def f():
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                yield i + j

    # ... Becomes ...

    def f():
        yield 0 + 0
        yield 0 + 1
        yield 0 + 2
        yield 1 + 0
        yield 1 + 1
        yield 1 + 2
        yield 2 + 0
        yield 2 + 1
        yield 2 + 2

You can also request to get the function source code instead of the compiled callable by using ``return_source=True``::

    In [1]: @pragma.unroll(return_source=True)
       ...: def f():
       ...:     for i in range(3):
       ...:         print(i)
       ...:

    In [2]: print(f)
    def f():
        print(0)
        print(1)
        print(2)

It also supports limited recognition of externally and internally defined values::

    @pragma.unroll(a=range)
    def f():
        for b in a(3):
            print(b)

    # Is equivalent to:

    a = range
    @pragma.unroll
    def f():
        for b in a(3):
            print(b)

    # Both of which become:

    def f():
        print(0)
        print(1)
        print(2)

Currently not-yet-supported features include:

- Handling constant sets and dictionaries (since the values contained in the AST's, not the AST nodes themselves, must be uniquely identified)
- Tuple assignments (``a, b = 3, 4``)
- ``zip``, ``reversed``, and other known operators, when performed on definition-time constant iterables
